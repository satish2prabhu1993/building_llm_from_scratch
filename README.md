LLM From Scratch - Tutorial Series (Work in Progress)

This repository is dedicated to building a step-by-step tutorial series
that walks through the process of developing a Large Language Model (LLM) from the ground up.

The primary goal is to provide a clear and practical learning path for those interested
in understanding the foundational concepts and implementation details behind LLMs â€”
from tokenization and training data preparation to model architecture, training loops, and inference.

ðŸ“˜ Reference Text:
This project is heavily inspired by and follows the structure of the book:
"Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)" by Sebastian Raschka
Available at: https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch

ðŸš§ Status:
This is a work in progress (WIP). Notebooks and modules will be added incrementally
as we build up each component of the model and its training pipeline.

Stay tuned and feel free to contribute, give feedback, or raise issues!
